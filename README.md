Created a simple timer application, Timer application is a software designed to measure time intervals. It allows users to set a specific duration, after which an alert or notification is triggered. Timer apps are commonly used for various purposes, such as cooking, exercise, productivity, and managing time during presentations or meetings. They often include features like multiple timers, customizable alerts, and the ability to run in the background while using other applications. Timer apps can be found on various platforms, including mobile devices, computers, and smartwatches, catering to different user needs and preferences.
Throught out this simple project I used HTML5 and CSS3 for user interface and Add JavaScript for behaviour.
